Decentralization and Democracy in Mining Pools

- Pool HR: This row displays the current hashrate of the Monero mining pool you are connected to. The hashrate is measured in hashes per second (H/s) and indicates the computational power of the pool.

- Network HR: This row displays the current hashrate of the entire Monero network. The hashrate is measured in hashes per second (H/s) and indicates the total computational power of all the miners on the network.

- Network height: This row displays the current block height of the Monero blockchain. Each new block added to the blockchain increases the block height by one.

- Blocks found: This row displays the total number of blocks that have been found by the Monero mining pool you are connected to.

- Last block found: This row displays the timestamp of the last block that was found by the Monero mining pool you are connected to.

- Last template: This row displays the timestamp of the last mining template that was fetched by the mining pool. A mining template is a set of instructions that tells the miners which block to work on and how to structure their mining efforts.

- Round HR: This row displays the hashrate of the current mining round in the pool. A mining round is a period of time during which miners work on a particular block.

- Round hashes: This row displays the number of hashes that have been submitted by miners during the current mining round.

- Payment threshold: This row displays the minimum balance required for a miner to receive a payment from the pool.

- Pool fee: This row displays the percentage of mining rewards that are taken by the pool as a fee for providing mining services.

- Pool port: This row displays the port number that should be used for connecting to the Monero mining pool.

- Pool SSL port: This row displays the SSL port number that should be used for connecting to the Monero mining pool.

- Allow self-select: This row indicates whether the pool allows miners to select which block to work on, or whether the pool selects the block for them.

- Miners connected: This row displays the number of miners currently connected to the Monero mining pool.

- Your HR: This row displays the hashrate of your own mining rig, if you have connected it to the Monero mining pool.

- Balance due: This row displays the amount of Monero that you have earned from mining and that is currently due to be paid to you.

- Miner address: This row displays the Monero wallet address associated with your mining rig. This is the address to which mining rewards will be paid.
